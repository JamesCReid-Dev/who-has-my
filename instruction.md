## Architecture: Clean Architecture Layers

The project follows strict **Clean Architecture** with four layers. Dependency direction is enforced at compile time via linter rules — **inner layers must never import outer layers**.

```
presentation/          ← UI, widgets, navigation, theme
    ↓ (imports only)
application/           ← Business logic, providers, use cases
    ↓ (imports only)
domain/                ← Entities, value objects, repositories interfaces
    ↓ (imports only)
infrastructure/        ← Storage implementations, external services
```

### Layer Responsibilities

- **`lib/domain/`** — Pure business entities (`Item`, `Contact`, `Loan`), value objects (`RiskLevel`), and repository interfaces. No framework dependencies whatsoever.
- **`lib/application/`** — Riverpod providers, business logic orchestration. Imports domain only.
- **`lib/infrastructure/`** — Hive storage implementation, adapters. Imports domain and application as needed.
- **`lib/presentation/`** — Flutter widgets, routing (`AppRouter`), theming (`AppTheme`). Imports everything else.

### Layer Barrel Files

Each layer has a barrel export file:
- `lib/domain/domain.dart`
- `lib/application/application.dart`
- `lib/infrastructure/infrastructure.dart`

Use these barrel imports in production code to keep import chains short and maintainable.

---

## Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Classes / Enums | PascalCase | `Item`, `ItemStatus`, `LoanProvider` |
| Variables / Functions | camelCase | `createdAt`, `getLoanedItems()` |
| Files / Directories | snake_case | `dashboard_provider.dart`, `risk_level.dart` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_NAME_LENGTH` (if used) |
| Private members | leading underscore | `_boxName`, `_validate()` |

### Entity Field Naming

- Use `id` for primary keys (Hive key format: `"item:{uuid}"`)
- Use `createdAt` and `updatedAt` for timestamps
- Nullable fields use `?` type annotation explicitly
- Default values via constructor parameters, not `copyWith` defaults where possible

---

## Code Generation Rules

All generated files live alongside their source with `.g.dart`, `.freezed.dart`, or `.hive_adapter.g.dart` extensions.

### Mandatory Practices

1. **Always run `build_runner`** after modifying:
   - Freezed classes → generates `.freezed.dart`
   - JSON-serializable classes → generates `.g.dart`
   - Hive adapters → generates `.hive_adapter.g.dart`
   - Riverpod providers with annotations → generates `.riverpod.dart`

2. **Never manually edit generated files** — they are overwritten by `build_runner`.

3. **Use `part 'file.dart';` and `part of` directives** correctly for partials.

4. **Freezed classes**:
   - Prefer `@freezed` over manual `copyWith`, `==`, `hashCode`
   - Use named constructors for different factory patterns
   - Annotate with `@JsonSerializable()` when serialization is needed

5. **Hive adapters**:
   - Register all adapters in `main.dart` before `runApp()`
   - Hive key format: `"entity_type:{uuid}"` (e.g., `"item:{uuid}"`)
   - Use `Hive.initFlutter()` in `main()` before any UI renders

---

## Riverpod Patterns

- Providers live in `lib/application/providers/`
- Use `@riverpod` annotation for auto-generated providers
- Prefer `AsyncNotifierProvider` for async state, `StateNotifierProvider` for sync
- Never hold `BuildContext` references in providers
- Use `ref.watch()` / `ref.read()` / `ref.listen()` per Riverpod conventions

---

## Linting & Analysis Rules (from `analysis_options.yaml`)

### Critical Rules (Never Violate)

| Rule | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `avoid_relative_lib_imports: true` | Always use `package:` imports |
| `always_use_package_imports: true` | Enforces package-style imports |
| `prefer_relative_imports: false` | Disables relative imports |

### Important Rules

- `avoid_print: true` — No `print()` in production code; use a logger
- `always_declare_return_types: true` — Explicit return types on all functions
- `type_annotate_public_apis: true` — Annotate public method/constructor signatures
- `avoid_returning_null_for_future: true` — Return `Future<T>` with empty result, not `null`
- `avoid_returning_null_for_string: true` — Return `''`, not `null` for strings

### Disabled Rules (Intentional)

- `sort_constructors_first: false` — Constructor order flexibility
- `use_build_context_synchronously: false` — Allowed with caution in widgets

---

## Testing Guidelines

- Test files go in `test/` alongside `lib/`
- Follow the existing naming pattern: `main_test.dart`, `widget_test.dart`
- Use `flutter_test` package for widget and unit tests
- Mock repositories/interfaces at layer boundaries
- Test domain logic in isolation (no Flutter framework needed)

---

## Import Rules

### ✅ Correct

```dart
import 'package:whohasmy/domain/entities/item.dart';
import 'package:whohasmy/application/providers/dashboard_provider.dart';
import 'package:whohasmy/infrastructure/storage/hive_storage.dart';
```

### ❌ Incorrect

```dart
import '../domain/entities/item.dart';          // Relative import — forbidden
import '../../lib/domain/entities/item.dart';   // Absolute path — forbidden
```

## General Guardrails for Cline

1. **Always respect Clean Architecture boundaries** — never let domain code depend on presentation or infrastructure.
2. **Use `package:` imports exclusively** — the linter enforces this.
3. **Declare all return types explicitly** — required by analysis options.
4. **Run `build_runner` after changes to annotated classes** — Freezed, Hive, JSON, Riverpod generators must be re-run.
5. **No `print()` statements** — use proper logging if needed.
6. **Never return `null` for `Future<T>` or `String`** — handle gracefully instead.
7. **Use `const` constructors where possible** — Flutter performance best practice.
8. **Keep widgets small and composable** — follow Flutter widget composition patterns.
9. **Document public APIs with doc comments** (`///`) — especially entities, providers, and repository interfaces.
10. **When in doubt, match existing code style** — refer to `lib/domain/entities/item.dart` as a reference for entity conventions.

## Documentation & Agile Practices

### Confluence — Technical Documentation

All technical documentation updates must be created and maintained in the **Confluence space "Project-WhoHasMy"**. This includes:

- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- API documentation
- Design specifications and wireframes
- Release notes and changelogs
- Onboarding guides and runbooks
- Technical deep-dives and research findings
- Meeting notes for technical discussions

**Rules:**
- Place new pages under the appropriate space tree section that matches their topic (e.g., architecture docs under an "Architecture" folder, release notes under a "Releases" folder).
- Link to Confluence pages from code comments using full URLs when referencing external design or spec documents.
- Keep code-level documentation in `///` doc comments within the Dart source; use Confluence for higher-level, human-readable documentation that benefits from formatting, images, and collaboration.

### Jira — Agile & Project Tracking

All agile and project management documentation must be created and maintained in the **Jira space "WhoHasMy"**. This includes:

- Epics, stories, tasks, sub-tasks, and bugs
- Sprint planning and backlog grooming records
- Velocity reports and burndown charts
- Dependencies between issues (blocking, relates-to, duplicates)
- Acceptance criteria and definition of done per story
- Cross-team or cross-project tracking links

**Rules:**
- Every code change that implements user-facing functionality must be linked to a Jira story or task via the issue key in commit messages (e.g., `PROJ-123: implement item status filtering`).
- Epics should represent major features or architectural changes; stories should be small enough to complete within a single sprint.
- Update issue statuses promptly — code merged implies "Done," testing completed implies "Ready for QA," etc.
- Use Jira labels consistently (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `bug`, `enhancement`) for filtering and reporting.

## Software Development Lifecycle — Story Implementation Workflow

This process defines the step-by-step workflow to follow when a story or task has been requested to begin implementation in Jira.

### Phase 1: Branch Creation & Setup

1. **Create a new Git branch locally** using the naming pattern:
   ```
   <assigned-to-owner>-<phase>-<story-number>
   ```
   - `<assigned-to-owner>` — The developer's initials or username (e.g., `jc`, `jsmith`)
   - `<phase>` — The development phase, such as:
     - `dev` for standard feature development
     - `bugfix` for bug fixes
     - `hotfix` for urgent production fixes
     - `refactor` for code refactoring
     - `test` for test-only changes
   - `<story-number>` — The **Story number** from the Jira artifact (e.g., `STORY037`, `STORY-036`). This is NOT the Jira issue key.

   > **Important:** Use the Story number, not the Jira issue ID/key. The story number follows the pattern `STORY###` and can be found in the story's summary or description field.
   >
   > **Example:** `jc-dev-STORY037` or `jsmith-bugfix-STORY025`

2. **Push the new branch to the remote origin repository:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

3. **Ensure the branch is checked out and set as the active working branch.**

### Phase 2: Jira Artifact Initialization

4. **Transition the Jira issue to `In Progress`** using the proper workflow transition (not just changing status). This ensures the issue moves to the correct swimlane/column on the Jira board.
    - Use a transition name like `"Start Progress"` or `"In Progress"` — not a raw status value.
    - Verify the issue now appears in the active/in-progress column of the sprint board.

5. **Assign the Jira artifact** to the requestor/assignee unless a specific assignee was called out in the story description or comments. Use the same person for both the Jira assignment and the branch ownership.

### Phase 3: Implementation & Testing

6. **Implement the story requirements** following Clean Architecture boundaries, naming conventions, and code generation rules defined elsewhere in this document.

7. **Ensure automated testing is part of the story acceptance criteria (A/C):**
   - Write unit tests for domain logic and business rules
   - Write widget/integration tests for UI changes
   - Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
   - Run `flutter test` locally before committing

8. **Review design documentation for impacted changes:**
   - Check Confluence pages in the **"Project-WhoHasMy"** space if architecture, API specs, or user-facing docs are affected by this story
   - Check Figma designs if UI/UX changes are made
   - If NO design updates needed: note "No design changes required for this story" in Jira comments
   - If design updates ARE needed: update Confluence/Figma first, then link to updated design in Jira before proceeding

9. **Execute all tests and add results to the Jira artifact:**
    - Run `flutter test` locally and ensure ALL tests pass (no failures, no errors)
    - Capture the full test output including: total tests run, passed/failed counts, any coverage metrics
    - Post the test results as a **comment on the Jira story** with the following format:
      ```
      ## Test Results
      - Total tests: X
      - Passed: X
      - Failed: 0
      - Errors: 0

      ### Test Output
      [paste full flutter test output here]

      ### Files Tested
      - test/path/to/file_test.dart
      - test/another_file_test.dart
      ```
    - Include any manual testing notes if applicable

10. **Only after ALL tests pass and results are posted as a Jira comment, transition to In Review.**

### Phase 4: Code Review & Pull Request

10. **Update the Jira artifact status to `In Review`** once implementation is complete and all acceptance criteria are met.

11. **Stage and commit all changed files** with a commit message following this pattern:
    ```
    <jira-artifact-id>-<status>
    ```
    - `<jira-artifact-id>` — The Jira issue key (e.g., `WHM-123`)
    - `<status>` — Current status of the change (e.g., `dev-complete`, `bugfix-resolved`, `docs-updated`)

    **Example:** `WHM-123-dev-complete` or `WHM-99-bugfix-resolved`

12. **Push all committed files to the remote origin repository:**
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

13. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** from the feature branch to the target branch (typically `main` or `develop`):
    - Link the PR to the Jira artifact in the PR description
    - Include a summary of changes, test results, and any notes for reviewers
    - Reference impacted Confluence pages or Figma designs where applicable
    - Request reviews from appropriate team members
